# CS-1332
Data Structures and Algorithms (Java)
## Course Objectives
* Develop more skills in individual Java programming
* Work with common data structures used in software development by coding their low-level implementation
    * Arrays, ArrayLists,
    * LinkedLists (Singular, Doubly, Circular)
    * Stack, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues
    * Various Trees; Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Splay, Heaps, 2-4 Trees, etc…
    * Hash Maps/Tables; External Chaining and Probing
    * Graphs and their algorithms
* Become familiar with common algorithms on these data structures
    * Sorting Algorithms; Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Cocktail Shaker, Merge, Quick, Radix etc...
    * Pattern Matching Algorithms: Brute force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, Rabin-Karpe
    * Graph algorithms; Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and multiple MSTs
    * Dynamic Programming algorithms
* Work with Big-O notation, allowing good choices about the appropriate data structure and algorithm to use for a particular programming  problem
* Improve one's ability to test and debug programs
